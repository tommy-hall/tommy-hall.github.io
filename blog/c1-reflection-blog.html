      Notice that we have three stylesheet links: the first two are for the Skeleton framework,

      bright pink.
    
      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

                        <li><strong>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</strong></li>
                        Really enjoying the EDA experience so far.<br>
                        <br><li><strong>What are your impressions?</strong></li>
                        Seems like EDA has a great community of teachers and students and enjoying the whole learning process.<br>
                        <br><li><strong>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</strong></li>
                        Getting involved and asking lots of questions. Also making sure I comply with the three pillars of Dev Academy.<br> 
                        <br><li><strong>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</strong></li>
                        Not really, apart from there's a lot more too learn in Phase 0 than I thought.<br>
                        <br><li><strong>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</strong></li>
                        Excited to join this type of learning environment, as said in the video above it will be like being in a restaurant kitchen. A little nervous to how much I need too learn before Bootcamp.
