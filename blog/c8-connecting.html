              <h2>Connecting</h2>
                  
              Everyone is born with 'built-in Empathy', however we feel it more for people with whom we share a connection i.e. family members, friends etc. We can increase our level of empathy towards others with practice. If you regularly think about the similarities 
              you have with other people, then wish them happiness and good fortune, you will feel a stronger connection and have more empathy for them in the future. The more you practice this, the more natural it will become and before long you will find yourself wishing 
              people happiness subconsciously. Research suggests that people who wish kindness on others, feel more happiness themselves, and so it's a real win-win situation.

              Empathy also enables us to build trusting relationships with others, as listening and understanding helps us to establish a close connection. As we all know, relationships are nothing without trust, and so by being more sincere, kind and open we are able to 
              build stronger relationships at home and at work. Remember that other people are human beings just like you, who have feelings just like you, like to be listened to and understood just like you, and want to be happy just like you.<br><br>


              <ul>
                  <li><strong>Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</strong></li>
                  
                  Empathy helps us build trust. When we interact with empathy, we increase the likelihood that people feel seen, heard, and understood. When people feel those things, they feel safer and more likely to trust the person who understands them.
                  Key thinkers on effectiveness at work have trust as the foundation of their practices and approaches. For example, Marc Lesser, an accomplished executive coach, suggests the coaching /mentoring cycle to involve these steps: 1. Establish trust, 2.Listen (by “looping” and “dipping”),
                  3. Ask probing and open-ended questions, 4. Provide feedback, 5. Partner to create options and practices. The most important step is the first step, establishing trust. Trust is the foundation of a coaching /mentoring relationship. It is very simple: for you to work with your mentee, 
                  he must be open to you. The more he opens himself up, the more effectively you can work with him, and the more he trusts you, the more likely he is to be open. It is that simple. If there is no trust, this mentoring relationship will just be a waste of time. I have tried this exercise
                  by Marc Lesser and I found it helpful to build trust and friendship. <br>
                  



                 <br>

                 <li><strong>Try empathic listening - how did it go?</strong></li>

                The qualities that are most conducive to empathic listening are mindfulness and kindness. If you can beforehand do a few minutes of Mindfulness Meditation. When your mind is in that mindful state, you will be more able to pay attention to feelings, 
                both your own and the other person’s. You will also be more able to listen without judging, which allows you to become more open to what you will hear. 
                If you have more time, do a few minutes of the 'Loving Kindness Meditation' exercise to put yourself in the frame of mind makes the other person more receptive to you, and you more receptive to him or her.

                 A good exercise for buidling trust and establishing close relationships is 'Empathetic Listening'. One person listens intently to another person (as in with mindful listening) but instead of listening just for content, also listen for feelings
                 and emotions. When the person has finished talking, say back to them what you heard them say and how you think that makes them feel. I enjoyed emathic listening and I think it's not only helpful to be listened to intently but also listen to the emotion 
                 in the other persons voice, which allows you too relate with that person more. <br>
                  
                 <br>

                 <li><strong>How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</strong></li>

                 The 'Loving Kindness Meditation' is a way of highlighting your connection to others and the good wishes you have for them with the aim of creating a mental habit of kindness.
                 I tried this and found it a positive experience and it would be useful to resolve conflicts with other people.<br><br>
                  
          
                        <code>Setup</code><br>

                        Sit in a comfortable position that allows you to be alert and relaxed at the same time. Start with 2 minutes to rest the mind on the breath.<br><br>
                       

                        <code>Just Like Me</code><br>

                        Now, read the script below slowly to yourself, pausing at the end of each sentence for reflection:<br>
                        <i>This person has a body and a mind, just like me.<br>
                        This person has feelings, emotions, and thoughts, just like me.....</i><br><br>


                        <code>Loving Kindness</code><br>

                        Now, let’s allow some wishes to arise.<br>
                        <i>I wish for this person to have the strength, the resources, and the emotional and social support to navigate the difficulties in life</i><br>
                        <i>I wish for this person to be free from pain and suffering.</i><br>

                     
                        <br><code>Closing</code><br>

                        End with 1 minute of resting the mind. <br>
            
            
                 <br>

                 <li><strong>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing.</strong></li>
                  
                 The Political Awareness exercise works as either a written or reading exercise whereby firstly you think of a difficult situation from your present or past, when there was some conflict or disagreement, something real, something that has some meaning and potency for you.
                 Secondly describe the situation as though you are 100 percent correct and reasonable. Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue. Finally, describe the situation as though the other person is (or the other people are) 100 percent correct and reasonable. 
                 Do that either in writing or by talking about it in a monologue. The main purpose of this exercise is to practice seeing the perspectives of different players (in this case, yourself and another party) objectively. You may notice that the instructions were worded very carefully. 
                 The key learning point (that is, the kicker) is the insight that the stories in steps two and three can very often be precisely the same story. In other words, conflict does not always arise because one side is wrong or unreasonable. It is entirely possible for both sides to be 100 percent 
                 correct and 100 percent reasonable and still have conflict.

                 For this exercise I used the example in golf of putting with Mallets v Blades.<br>
        

                 <br>

                 <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
                  
                <ul>

                 <li>A great example of making difficult decisions with empathy is found in Goleman’s example of Working with Emotional Intelligence:
 
                    GE workers were given two years’ notice that the plant would be closed, and the company made an intense outplacement effort to help them find other jobs. The other company announced the closing with just one week’s notice, and made no effort to help workers locate other employment.
                    The results? Almost a year later, the majority of the former GE workers said it had been a good place to work, and 93 percent lauded the transition services offered them. At the other company, only 3 percent said it had been a good place to work. GE preserved a large pool of goodwill, while the other firm left a legacy of bitterness.</li>

                    <li>Similarly, trust is the essential foundation of a highly effective team. In The Five Dysfunctions of a Team, Patrick Lencioni describes five ways a team becomes dysfunctional in the form of a pyramid.
                    The five dysfunctions, in order of causality are: 1. Absence of Trust, 2. Fear of Conflict, 3. Lack of Committment, 4. Avoidance of accountability, 5. Intentional to Results. In essence it all begins with trust. The absence of trust is the root cause of all other dysfunctions.</li>

                    <li> Whenever Cheng chairs a meeting, he brings the practice he calls Three Assumptions: He invites everybody in the meeting room to make the following assumptions about everybody else:
 
                            1. Assume that everybody in this room is here to serve the greater good, until proven otherwise.
                             
                            2. Given the above assumption, we therefore assume that none of us has any hidden agenda, until proven otherwise.
                             
                            3. Given the above assumption, we therefore assume that we are all reasonable even when we disagree, until proven otherwise.
                             
                            He finds that when you begin a meeting with these assumptions, there is a greater sense of trust in the room. He recommends this simple practice as a way to foster trust within your team. Do this at every meeting, and you may find your team members gradually gravitating toward mutual trust.</li>
