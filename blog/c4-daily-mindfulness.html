              <ul>
                  <li><strong>What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</strong></li>
                  
                  As stated in the book, “When we do formal practice in class, the most common feedback is people really appreciate being listened to.” I definately found this too be the case, as it was nice to be not interrupted during the conversation, the other person found this as well. 

                  Also as stated in the book, “We frequently hear people telling us right after this exercise, “I got to know this person for six minutes, and we are already friends. Yet there are people who have been sitting in the next cubicle for months, and I don’t even know them.” This is 
                  the power of attention. Just giving each other the gift of total attention for six minutes is enough to create a friendship.”. This is also true as you may be in an environment such as an office for years and you may never have given someone 5-10 minutes of your attention. 
                  Thus, "Our attention is the most valuable gift we can give to others. <br>


                    <br><li><strong>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</strong></li>
                        
                    In Chapter Three we learn about everyday mediation techniques:

                    <ol>
                    <li>Walking Meditation - While you are walking, focus your attention on the feelings and movements around your body; if the mind begins to wander, gently bring it back.</li>

                    <li>Mindful Listening - Find a buddy, and buddy up with that person. Focus all of your attention on listening to your buddy-companion and allow them to talk about something important for 3-5 minutes. When time is up, switch roles. If either person runs out of 
                        things to say, just give them space for silence, and then be available to listen when they speaks again.”</li>
                    
                    <li>Mindful Conversation - There are 3 components to mindful conversation: listening, looping & dipping
                    Listening - As above.
                    Looping - When 'Mindful Listening' time is up, repeat back to your buddy what you understood them saying. When you have finished, invite your buddy to provide feedback on any parts you may have missed out or misinterpreted. Continue to loop back and forth, until you are completely
                    clear on how your buddy is feeling about the given topic. Then switch.
                    Dipping - Not Dipping is resisting going off on your own train of thought while your buddy is talking. Distractions in one's own head are the main reason for one not listening. The best way to respond to these internal distractions is to notice and acknowledge them. Know that they are 
                    there, try not to judge them, and let them go if they are willing to go. If feelings or other internal distracters decide to stay around, let them be and just be aware of how they may affect your listening. You can think of dipping as self-directed mindfulness during listening.

                    
                    </li>
                    </ol>
            
                    <br><li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
                            
                            <ul>
                            <li>
                            In the book it discussed that there are two complementary qualities of physical fitness: strength and stamina. To be a well-rounded athlete, it is good to have both. Similarly, there are two complementary qualities of attention: focused attention and open attention. To be an accomplished meditator, it is good to be strong in both.
                            Focused attention is an intense focus on a chosen object. It is stable, strong, and unwavering. It is a mind like a closely guarded royal palace
                            where only the most honored guests are allowed to enter and all others are courteously but firmly turned away.
                            Open attention is a quality of attention willing to meet any object that arrives at the mind or the senses. It is open, flexible, and inviting. It is a mind like an open house with a friendly host, where anybody who walks in is welcomed as an honored guest.
                            The good news is when you are doing mindfulness meditation, you are training both focused attention and open attention.</li>

                            <li>In meditation it is possible to get into a very good state of ease and flow. When you are engaged in an activity you are very good at, such as skiing, dancing, or writing code, and if you are in a state where your full attention is on the activity and it is fun,
                                 easy, and sufficiently challenging at the same time, then you may get into a state of flow in which you are performing at your best yet your mind is at ease. Similarly, with enough practice, it is possible to become skillful at playing with attention and getting 
                                 into a state of flow when it feels fun and easy at the same time, just by sitting. 
                            </li>

                            <li>Finally, a lesson that can be learned from this chapter is to avoid feeling discouraged when your meditation does not seem to be progressing. If you understand the process, you may understand that when change does come, it will come suddenly, and every moment of effort 
                                brings you a little closer to that point. The classical analogy is ice breaking up on a frozen lake. To a casual observer, the breakup seems like a sudden phenomenon, but it is actually due to a long period of gradual melting of the underlying ice structure. In Zen, we call it gradual effort and sudden enlightenment.
                                So the next time you see a baby learn to walk, pay some attention. That baby is really a Zen master teaching you a thing or two about progress in your meditation. 
                                    
                                 </li>
