        <li><strong>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</strong></li>
        <ol>
        <li>How much they value Emotional Intelligence & Mindfulness at Google. Google allows its engineers to spend 20% of their time working on projects outside their core jobs. </li>
        <li>The happiest of a person can be scientically measured by the way of gauaging the happiness in the brain. "By measuring the realative activation of a certain part
            of your left prefrontal cortex versus your right prefrontal cortex. The stronger the realtive left-tilt is measure in a person, the more that person reports positive emotions, such as joy,
            enthusiasm, high energy, and so on. The reverse is also true; those with higher activity on the right report negative emotions. This man is Matthieu Richard who is a bald french guy.</li>
        <li>Emotional Intelligence enables three important skills sets: Stellar work performance, out-standing leadership, and the ability to create the conditions for happiness</li>
        <li>To drive one of the black cabs in London, the driver must remember & hence be able to navigate through the 25,000 streets of London. He must also remember all the points 
            of interest of London. "This is a difficult test that can take two to four years of intense training to prepare for. Research has shown that the part of the brain associated with memory
            and spatial navigation, the hippocampus, is bigger and more active in London cabbies than in the average person. More interestingly, the longer someone has been driving a cab in London, the 
            larger and more active her hippocampus"</li>
        <li>A simple technique for self-regulation called the "affect labeling", which simply means labeling feelings with words. For example when you feel angry if you label that emotion with
            "I feel anger", it somehow helps you to manage that emotion.</li>
        <li>A useful reason to develop a high-resolution perception of the body is to strengthen our intuition. A lot of you intuition comes from our body. For example: University of Iowa did a scietific
            experiment where they had 4 sets of cards (2 of them where red & 2 of them blue), each card in those decks either lost you some money or costs you some money, your job is to turn over the cards
            one at a time to try and maximise your winnings. What you don't know at the beginning is the red cards are losing cards and the blue cards are winning cards. The question is how long will it take
            for people to figure this out? What was interesting is that after 10 cards the gamblers started to generate stress responses (they hooked up each gambler to a polygrapgh - a lie detector machone - that measures the activity of the sweat glands that all
            of us have below the skin in the palms of our hands). Most sweat glands respond to temperature, but those in our palms open up in response to stress - which is why we get clammy hands when we are nervous.
            However what's even more interesting is that only after 50 cards did people start to develop a hunch about whta's going on. After 80 cards, most people have figured the game out & can see that the first two card decks (red)
            are a bad idea. </li>
        <li>Put simply mindfulness is the mind of just being. All you really need to do is pay attention moment-to-moment without judging. It's that simple. Two experience a taste of mindfulness try the Easy way and the Easier way.
            The Easy way is to pay attention to your breath & the easiest way is too just sit without agenda for two minutes. Too make it easier switch between the two. This simple exercise is mindfulness practice. If practiced often enough,
            it deepens the inherent calmness and clarity of the mind. It opens up the possibility of fully appreciating each moment in life.

        </ol>

        <br><li><strong>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</strong></li>
        I used the technique given to me by chapter 1 of the book: Search inside yourself, which was Easy way and the Easier way. Switching between the two allowed me too 
        remain calm/present with my thoughts and often I would drift off into my own thoughts for then I would focus on my breathing again. Overall I enjoyed the two minutes
        of mindfulness and I will continue to develop this important skill.<br>
