      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

              <ul>
                  <li><strong>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</strong></li>
                  Two of my triggers would be frustration and happiness. Frustation is caused when I am working on a simple problem for a long period of time (30 mins or more) and I can't get the correct answer. 
                  When I finally get the right answer I feel a great sense of happiness though. As we begin to explore more difficult concepts in Javascript further into the course I may start to feel other emotions that 
                  will trigger a disproportionate repsonse.<br><br>

                  What was also helpful was the four general principles with dealing with any distressing emotions: 
                  <ol>
                        <li>Know when you are not in pain</li>
                        <li>Do not feel bad about feeling bad</li>
                        <li>Do not feed the monsters</li>
                        <li>Start every thought with kindness and humor</li>
                    </ol>



                    <br><li><strong>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</strong></li>
                    
                    The Siberian North Railroad practice is used for dealing with triggers. This is a useful practice not only for triggers but also for other situations in which we need to deal with negative or distressing emotions.
                    The practice has five steps:

                   <ol>
                       <li>Stop- The most important step.</li>
                       <li>Breathe- Deep breaths help to calm the body.</li>
                       <li>Notice- Focus on the changes in tension and temperature around the body.</li>
                       <li>Reflect- Where is the emotion coming from? Bring perspective without judging to be right or wrong.</li>
                       <li>Respond- Which response(s) would/could result in a positive outcome?</li>
                   </ol>

                   I found the Siberian North Railroad exercise helpful especially the first two steps to stop and breath. The stop step is known as the Sacred Pause which enables the other steps. Instead of activating the 'fight-or-flight' 
                   response, these steps allows you too calm the body & mind and then move forward in a more appropriate manner.
