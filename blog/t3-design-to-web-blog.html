      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

              <ul>
                    <li><strong> What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.</strong></li>
                    A responsive site is one which makes web pages render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. The site must work on different devices, different browsers & different operating systems. 
                    Responsive Design have to be 1. Flexible which means it adjusts for the size of the screen and 2. Adjustable which means the contents on the page can change and move around depending on the size of screen - 
                    e.g. @media only screen and (min-width:40em)
            
                    This is particularly important nowadays, because of the large number of internet-accessible devices available and the wide variation of their screen sizes. What looks good on a desktop computer will not
                    look good on a mobile device without adjusting the formatting.<br>
            
            
                    <br><li><strong>What mobile first design is, and why it's important.</strong></li>
                    Mobile First design means that when you are designing multiple page layouts for the same sitem you start with mobile-phone sized first and then scale up from there. This is the smallest screen size that 
                    needs to be considered and so it makes you think about what are the most important elements to fit on the page. It is alot easier to start small and then add content and spread content around as you grow, 
                    rather than starting big and then trying to squeeze all the content in and end up having to get rid of half of it. <br>
            
                    <br><li><strong>What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.</strong></li>
                    There are many different frameworks available to assist developers in building responsive websites  A framework is a software package made up of ready-made blocks code to help developers build sections of websites 
                    and software programmes. An analgoy is when a house is built, the builders don't make their own bricks, windows or screws; they have specialists who have already made these products.
                    Frameworks are the providers of bricks, windows and screws of code that developers can use to build their digital houses.<br>
            
            
                    <br><li><strong>What a wireframe is and why we use it.</strong></li>
                    
                    A wireframe document for a person profile view.
                    A website wireframe is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website.Wireframes are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish
                    a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective and a creative idea. The wireframe depicts the page layout or arrangement of the websiteâ€™s content,
                    including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together. <br>

                    I have done a bit of wireframing before so I didn't find it too difficult. I used Balsamiq Mockups, as the website says "Rapid, effective and fun wireframing software",
                    and that's exactly how I found this software package.<br>
