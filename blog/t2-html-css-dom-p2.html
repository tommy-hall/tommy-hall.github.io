        <li><strong>What is grid based design?</strong></li>
        Grid based design is a quick, easy & flexible way to create a responsive web site using a 12-column grid. Each row of the grid consists of 12 columns and each of these columns are of equal width. 
        Each HTML element contained in the grid is assigned a number of columns to occupy and their width is then calculated using a percentage value (e.g. 3 columns = 25%). As there are 12 columns to each row,
        and 12 is a number that can easily be divided by 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12, there are a wide range of options for how each row can be layed out. Grid based design is highly effective for responsive layouts because regardless of the size of the screen, 
        e.g. 25% of a Desktop screen is still 25% of a Tablet Screen.<br>

        <br>Also our eyes naturally follow patterns when we look at things. Our eyes will look front left to right and then from top to bottom. It's best to have the title at the top because we want the user to see it first. 
        The images are usually placed well on the left to capture attention because people will look at the images first, then right to headline and down to text below it. This type of design follows what we call a Grid Based layout. 
        Many if not all websites follow a grid based layout. You can break your website down into smaller and smaller grids pieces of the grid. Next time on a website try to break it down into grids, you'll be surprised how easy it is.

        <br><li><strong>Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</strong></li>
        People use many different devices to access the internet (everything from large desktops, laptops, netbooks, tablets & phones).

        More & more people every year are accessing the internet through their phones or tablets. <br>
        

        <br><li><strong>What is semantic structure?</strong></li>
        
        Semantic Structue is laying out your HTML in a way that reinforces the information on the page, rather than merely to define its presentation or look.
        A good example of this would be headings on a page, for which there are 6 heading tags (h1-h6) which run in decreasing order of size and importance.<br>

        <br><li><strong>Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on.</strong></li>
        You can normalise your CSS for any browser by using this GitHub stylesheet - https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/ -
        Just link your code to the CSS Style from Normalize.

        <br>When you run into an issue with HTML or CSS the chances that someone else has run into that same issue are pretty good. Stackoverflow.com is a good resource where you can search for a similar problem you are encountering.
