              <h2>Javascript Basics</h2>
                  
              <ul>
                  <li><strong> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</strong></li>
                  
                  <ol>
                        <li>HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is used to create the basic structure and content of a webpage</li>
                        <li> CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is used for the design of a webpage â€“ where everything is placed and how it looks</li>
                        <li> JavaScript is used to define the interactive elements of a webpage that help to engage users</li>
                 </ol>

                    <br><li><strong> Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</strong></li>
                    The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 
                    For example, an analogy would be 'waking up'. The nornal "control flow" of 'waking up' and going through your morning routine would be to go through your morning routine, such as make your bed, brush your teeth, have a glass or water and so on. Occasionally however your morning routine may 
                    be slighly changed due to an urgent phone call or children that need to br dropped off early at school, this would be an "if" statement in Javascript. This is an adjustment to the top to bottom "control flow" of Javascript known as a conditional statement.<br> <br> Another variation to your morning
                    routine are repeated steps. For example, your morning routine may mean you have 4 glasses of water. Once you have completed this you can move onto the next task. In Javascipt this is known as a "loop", this allows you to repeat the same block of code a particular number of times, or while a certain
                    condition remains true. <br> <br> You may also see a combination of these two types of instructions. It might be that you follow your morning routine for the weekday where you follow the same steps each day, whereas in the weekend there's a slight variation to your morning routine. This should show that
                    while the "control flow" for Javascript does run from top to bottom like your morning routine, the order can change quite a bit through the use of conditional statements and loops. <br>
                
                    

                    <br><li><strong>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</strong></li>
                    Javascript stores multiple values of information in 'Objects' and 'Arrays'. The difference between the two being; arrays store all the information in a single variable, whereas objects can use multiple variables.
                    <br> <br> As Arrays contain multiple peices of data in one place, these peices of data are essentially stored in a numbered list that starts at number 0 and carries on for as long as your list of data is. To access data 
                    stored within an array you just need to specify the array you want to look at and the number in the list of the item you want to retrieve, known as its index. <br> <br> Objects also being a Javascript variable contain multiple peices
                    of data in one place, however the way it's recieved is slightly different. Instead of storing data in a numbered list, an object stores data in "properties" of the object. For example if the object was a car its properties might be 
                    the colour, engine capacity, number of doors etc. To access data stored within an object you specify the object and the property that you want to retrieve the data for. <br>
                    
            
                    <br><li><strong>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</strong></li>
                    Another very useful tool in the JavaScript inventory are 'functions'. Functions are step-by-step processes that are saved under particular function names. When the function name is called, the process is initiated. For example, when you
                    have your smoothie in a morning, there are a lot of steps involved; get the blender out of the cupboard, find the ingredients, open them  etc. We all know the steps in our head, and so when we decide to have a bowl of Cornflakes, all the 
                    steps happen seamlessly. This is 'functions' at work. Functions allows you to reuse sections of your code which can both save a lot of time as well as greatly increase the clarity of your code. <br> <br>
