      Notice that we have three stylesheet links: the first two are for the Skeleton framework,
      and the final one is for any custom styles we might need, like turning the background
      bright pink.
    
      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

              <ul>
                  <li><strong>What 'scope' is, and how it works in JavaScript.</strong></li>

                
                  In JavaScript there are two types of scope:

                <ol>
                <li>Local scope</li>
                <li>Global scope</li>
                </ol>

               <ul>
                <li>JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.</li>

                <li>Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.</li>

                <li>Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.</li>
                </ul>

                In <strong>Local JavaScript Variables</strong> variables declared within a JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function. Local variables have local scope: They can only be accessed within the function.<br>
                Since local variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables with the same name can be used in different functions. Local variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the function is completed.<br>

                <br>In <strong>Global JavaScript Variables</strong> variables declared outside a function, becomes GLOBAL. A global variable has global scope: All scripts and functions on a web page can access it.<br>

                
                <br><strong>Note </strong>in JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables. Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code. Also even if a value is assigned inside a function but
                the variable has not been declared, it will automatically become a GLOBAL variable.<br><br>
