                  <li><strong>How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</strong></li>
                  
                In Chapter 6 of 'Search Inside Yourself' we are introduced to Tony Hseih who's a young man who has been very successful including leading Zapos from 0 to $1bn+ in revenue through creating outstanding staff
                culture and excellent customer experiences. 

                Tony has great insights in the process of happiness in the context of work. He describes three types of happiness: pleasure, passion, and higher purpose.<br>
 
                <ol>
                <li><code>Pleasure</code> This type of happiness is about always chasing the next high. It is the rock-star type of happiness because it is very hard to maintain unless you are living the lifestyle of a rock star.</li>
                 
                <li><code>Passion</code> Also known as “flow,” where peak performance meets peak engagement, and time flies by.</li>
                 
                <li><code>Higher Purpose</code> This is about being part of something bigger than yourself that has meaning to you.</li>
                </ol>

                Within these three, their sustainability varies. It shows that the happiness that arises from pleasure is highly unsustainable because once your pleasurable stimulus ceases, or if you habituate to it, then your happiness returns to your default set point.
                Happiness that arises from flow is much more sustainable and you are far less likely to habituate to it. Happiness arising from higher purpose, in contrast, is highly sustainable. This form of happiness is very resilient and can last for a very long time, especially if that higher purpose has an altruistic origin.

                    <br><li><strong>  From the 'discovering values and higher purpose' exercise,
                            What are your core values?
                            What do you stand for?</strong></li>

                            To find our passion and our purpose, the secret lies in self-awareness and specifically self-assessment. What are we good at? What are we not good at? What do we like to do? What do we not like to do? I have asked these questions too myself a lot recently, which has have led me down the path to do this course.
                            I love innovation, collaboration and being part of a productive, exciting culture. I want to enjoy, that means being part of something that is ever-evolving. My aim through this course is too either land a job in a modern tech company or start my own tech company, with an innovative working environment, creating new apps and websites.

                    <li><strong>How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise?</strong></li>
                    This excercise involves by firstly calming the mind with 3 deep breaths, and also by focusing on different sensations in the body. Next it shifts into an experience of failure for 4 minutes whereby you observe all the associated emotions and see how they manifest in the body.
                    Your job is too see if we can create the ability to experience all those emotions without aversion. Consider these emotions you are experiencing as simply physiological sensations. That is all. They may be unpleasant, but they are simply experiences. Let’s simply allow these experiences 
                    to be present, to come as they wish, and to go as they wish. Just let them be, in a kind, gentle, generous way. Your next step is too repeat the exact same process for instead a feeling of success for 4 minutes. Finally, you just be present for 3 minutes. Check in with your body and how it feels now.
                    Take a deep breath and let go. Continue a relaxed attention on breathing and, if you feel so inclined, bring a hand up to rest on the chest. Continue noticing what happens in your body, and slowly open your eyes. I found this exercise useful as per the aversion definition: a feeling of repugnance toward something with a desire to avoid or turn from it. 
                    Remembering to allow thoughts too come and go intead of avoiding them.

                    <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>
                    Cheng talks to us about three easy steps to self motivation:

                    <ol>
                    <li><code>Alignment</code> Ensuring that what you are doing lines up with what you value most in life.</li>
                    <li><code>Envisioning</code> Once you are aligned, envision where you want to be. What is your ideal future?</li>
                    <li><code>Resilience</code> When your values are aligned and you can see your ideal future, resilience will help get you there.</li>
                    </ol>

                    Also the 3 most intrinsic motivators which drive people to do their best work:
                    <ol>
                    <li><code>Autonomy</code> The ability to direct our own lives.</li>
                    <li><code>Mastery</code> The desire to become better and better at a craft we really enjoy.</li>
                    <li><code>Purpose</code> Here it is again, being a valuable part of something greater.</li>
                    </ol>

                    Research shows that these 3 motivators are more effective in motivating better work and greater creativity than an increase in pay alone.<br><br>

                    Another great point Cheng touches on is how failue is the beginning, and the most important part, of success. If you are always in your comfort zone and don't feel confused, intimidated or stupid, then you will never be able to succeed. 
                    In order to succeed, you have to tackle the unknown, and in doing so we all risk facing failure. The real measure of success is not being able to never fail, but in how high we bounce back from failure.
