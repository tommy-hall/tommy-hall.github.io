              <ul>
                  <li><strong>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</strong></li>

                  From my experience, compassion and kindness are key qualities of successful leaders. There are people in life who will try to take advantage of a situation once they
                  sense an opportunity. Kindness and open-heartedness need to be balanced with good instict, judgement and discipline. Too much of one and not enough of the other will result in poor performance 
                  either because everyone hates you, or everyone walks all over you.<br>
                 
                  Also compassion is a mental state endowed with a sense of concern for the suffering of others and aspiration to see that suffering relieved.
 
                  Specifically, he defines compassion as having three components:
                   
                  1. A cognitive component: “I understand you”
                   
                  2. An affective component: “I feel for you”
                   
                  3. A motivational component: “I want to help you”
                  
                  
                 <br>
                

                 <br>

                 <li><strong>Do the multiplying goodness meditation. How did you find it?</strong></li>

                 The 'multiplying goodness meditation', exercise is very simple. When we breathe in, we visualize that we’re breathing in our own goodness, we visualize multiplying that goodness by ten in our hearts, and then when we breathe out, 
                 we visualize giving all that goodness to the world. After that, we breathe in the goodness of other people and do the same. If you want, you may visualize the goodness as white light. The more we practice this exercise the easier 
                 and more powerful it will become, but it definately makes you feel happy and upbeat from the first time you do it. The advanced level of this excercise called Tonglen meditation. I tried this and found it a positive experience and it 
                 would be useful in 1. Seeing goodness in self and others, 2. Giving goodness to all, 3. Confidence in the transformative power of self (that I can multiply goodness).<br>

              
                 <br>

                 <li><strong>Do the Tonglen meditation. How did you find it?</strong></li>

                 The traditional practice for developing compassion is something known as Tonglen, which in Tibetan means “giving and receiving". It is a lot like the Multiplying Goodness practice, except instead of breathing in goodness, you breathe in 
                 suffering (of self and others), and transform it within yourself. When you breathe out, you radiate love, kindness, and compassion. In order to master social skills, we have to clear out the emotional gunk—anger, fear, confusion, and even 
                 physical suffering, and our resistance to it all. Tonglen is a practice designed for this effect, centered on awareness of breathing. Tonglen literally means “giving and receiving,” willingness to receive the suffering and pain of others, 
                 and giving relief, well-being, and peace in return—thereby experiencing our ability to be transformers.
                 By breathing in negativity, we can use the heart as a filter. Breathing out, the dark clouds can pass through us, and transform into acceptance, ease, joy, and light/radiance. When we experience this, we strengthen the resolve that nothing can 
                 totally overcome us, which establishes deep confidence. This gives us a strong foothold to stand up for the well-being of ourselves and others, thereby building the foundation for compassion.<br>

                 Tonglen is a very powerful practice. The Dalai Lama is said to do this every day as one of his main practices. I experienced a strengthening of my self-confidence. and as Cheng says during the practice you realise that a lot of what is holding us back originated from our fear of pain and suffering. Once you found yourself capable of breathing in the pain and suffering of yourself and others, and comfortable radiating kindness, love, and compassion, a lot of the fetters holding us back dissolved away.<br>

                 <li><strong>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</strong></li>

                 In Your Brain at Work, David Rock describes five domains of social experience that the brain treats as primary rewards or threats. In other words, these five domains are so important to you that your brain treats them in the same way it treats survival issues. And because
                 they are so important, each is a major driver of social behavior. These five domains form a model which David calls the SCARF model, which stands for Status, Certainty, Autonomy, Relatedness, and Fairness.

                 You can influence people most effectively when you help people achieve what they want in a way that also helps you and simultaneously serves greater good. That is why the SCARF model from the previous section can be so valuable. By understanding the neuroscience 
                 of the social brain, you can better understand how your actions can increase the SCARF factors for self and others, hence you can figure out how to help people in ways that also align with your own interests.


                 SCARF model applies to Phase 0 thus far as we have met other people in the EDA community mostly online. The SCARF Model is something I feel I will be able to apply at bootcamp as I try to be a strong team player but having the actual five areas to refer to will definately help.<br>

                 <li><strong>Have a difficult conversation. How did it go? (It's a valuable skill, but can take practice to develop!)</strong></li>

                 Conducting difficult conversations is a skill, an extremely useful one, indeed. According to the authors of Difficult Conversations, who make up part of the Harvard Negotiation Project, there are five steps to conducting a difficult conversation:

                 <ol>
                        <li><code>Prepare by walking through the “three conversations."</code> What happened?, What emotions are involved?, What does this say about me? </li>
                        <li><code>Decide whether to raise the issue</code> What do you hope to accomplish by raising this issue?”. If you decide to raise the issue, try shifting into a mode that supports learning and problem solving. </li> 
                        <li><code>Start from the objective "third story"</code>  The third story is the best one with which to start a difficult conversation. It is the most objective and the one with which you are most likely to form a common ground with the other party. </li>
                        <li><code>Explore their story and yours</code>  Listen to their story. Empathize. Share your story. Explore how you each perceive the same situation differently. Reframe the stories from one of blame and accusation to one of learning about how each contributes to the situation and the emotions involved.</li>
                        <li><code>Problem Solve</code> Invent solutions that meet each side’s most important concerns and interests. Find ways to continue keeping communications open and taking care of each other’s interests. </li>
                </ol>
    
               
                Also the first key insight is that impact is not the intention. For example, if we feel hurt by something somebody said, we may automatically assume that the person intended to hurt us. In other words, we assume that the impact is the intention. Usually, we judge ourselves by our intentions, but we judge others by the 
                impact of their behavior because we do not really know their intentions, so we subconsciously infer their intentions based on the impact of their behavior. In many situations, however, the impact is not the intention. <br>

                 <li><strong>Any other musings?</strong></li>

                 <ul>
                 <li>You can make more friends in two months by becoming really
                 interested in other people than you can in two years by trying
                 to get other people interested in you. Which is just another
                 way of saying that the way to make a friend is to be one.
                 <strong>—Dale Carnegie</strong></li>

                 <li>As explained by the research conclusions of two renowned leadership scholars, Jim Kouzes and Barry Posner which looked at manager’s success. [They] found one, and only one, factor significantly differentiated the top quartile of managers from the bottom quartile … the single factor was high scores on affection—both expressed and wanted … the highest performing managers show more warmth and fondness toward others than do the bottom 25 percent. They get closer to people, and they are significantly more open in sharing thoughts and feelings than their low-performing counterparts.
                All things being equal, we will work harder and more effectively for people we like. And we like them in direct proportion to how they make us feel.</li>

                <li>Read the book by Jim Collins, Good to Great: Why Some Companies Make the Leap … and Others Don’t </li>

                <li>Warren Buffett, one of the richest men in the world, demonstrated that he understood the power of relatedness when he said, “When you get to my age, you’ll measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you. That’s the ultimate test of how you’ve lived your life. </li>

                </ul><br>
