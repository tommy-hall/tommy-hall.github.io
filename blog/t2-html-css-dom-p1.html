      Please don't make the background pink... have a little pity on your teachers!

                    <li><strong>List of design and structural features/Wishlist.</strong></li>
                    From the CSS Zen Garden - Number 206 - A Walk in the Garden (SIMON VAN HAUWERMEIREN, Belgium)<br>
                    From the CSS Zen Garden - Number 221 - Mid Century Modern - Andrew Lohman, United States<br>
            
                    <br>Structural featues include a clean website that's very basic in many ways but also very elegant for the reader to view.<br>
            
            
                    <br><li><strong>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</strong></li>
                    Think of HTML,CSS, DOM as a house. HTML is the structure of the house (i.e. where the walls are positioned), the CSS is the style of the house (i.e. what are the colours of the walls going to be),
                    the Document Object Model (DOM) is a written down blueprint (i.e. architechural drawing on how to build the house) of the HTML currently being displayed on the screen. Because HTML content is often automatically
                    generated as the page runs, the blueprint in the DOM may not match the original blueprint used to build the page. The HTML blueprint within the DOM can be directly altered and adjusted, and any changes made will be applied 
                    directly to the screen. But because the changes are only being made to the DOM and not to the original blueprint, the next time the page has to reload, it will refer back to the original blueprint and all changes will be gone.
                    Also the javascript is the interactive part (i.e. garage door opener/tv remote). Finally, there are rules in how your house behaves, you can't have a tv that isn't attached to the wall (rules for websites). Same goes for tools you 
                    can't put together a bookshelf without a screwdriver (lots of web tools to help you build a website).<br><br>
            
                    When displaying HTML, the DOM considers all individual pieces of code as separate nodes. All nodes are displayed by the DOM as a hierarchical family-tree-like structure.<br><br>
                    
                    Instead of HTML code, let's imagine we are converting your favourite novel into a DOM family-tree. In this scenario, the book itself would be the first node and would sit right at the top of the tree. Then, the direct 
                    children of the book node would be all the chapter nodes who sit one branch lower than the book node. The chapters would then be parents to the paragraphs, who would be parents to the sentances, who would be parents to the words, 
                    who eventually, would be parents to the individual letters from which the book was written. The letter nodes would sit right at the bottom of the DOM family-tree, as these are the lowest child elements in the book.<br>
                    
            
                    <br><li><strong>What is meant by boxifying design?</strong></li>
                    
                    Boxifying is the practice of logically breaking down a web-page design into a series of individual boxes, thereby making it easier to understand. 
                    This will allow for better communication and clearer instructions between the Web Designer and the Web Developer.<br>
            
                    <br><li><strong>What is the box model?</strong></li>
                    The Box Model consists of margins, borders, padding and content, which together make up every HTML element on the page. Each of these aspects can be adjusted to create different styles, effects and spacing.
                    The margin clears an area around the boarder, (it doesn't have background colour and is completely transparent - think of it as space between boxes) the border (goes around padding and content - the border is inherited from the colour property of the box),
                    padding clears an area around the content) and finally the content is the image or text (think of it as the nucleas as it sits in the centre and the other items serve to protect it).</li>
