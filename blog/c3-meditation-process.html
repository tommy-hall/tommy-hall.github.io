              <h2>Mediation Process</h2>
                  
              <ul>
                  <li><strong> How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</strong></li>
                  
                  This concept meant that instead of focusing on the product I build, I should instead focus on the learning process of building a website. This is far more important. 
                  The more fun you make your process, the less you actually think about your end-goal, the better your product will be.<br>  

                    <br><li><strong> What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</strong></li>
                    I thought it was a helpful tool that can help calm the mind & allow you to stay present, however I was amazed at some of the findings in chapter 2.<br>    
                    
                        
                    <br><li><strong>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</strong></li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>The Difference between Attention & Meta-Attention. “Attention is something we all understand. William James has a very nice definition for it: “taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form.”
                            “Meta-attention is attention of attention, the ability to pay attention to attention itself”. A good analogy was used about riding a bicycle.</li>
                        <li> When the mind is calm and clear at the same time, happiness spontaneously arises. “Alan said the reason is very simple: happiness is the default state of mind. So when the mind becomes calm and clear, 
                             it returns to its default, and that default is happiness. That is it. There is no magic; we are simply returning the mind to its natural state.”</li>
                        <li> Meditation is like the Pot analogy & Exercise. "“Every time your attention wanders away from your breath and you bring it back, it is like flexing your biceps—your “muscle” of attention grows a bit stronger.”
                            There's no such thing as bad meditation and also both exercise and meditation can both significantly change the quality of your life.” “After a few weeks or months of starting a regular meditation regime, you have
                            more energy; your mind becomes calmer, clearer, and more joyful; you get sick less; you smile more; your social life improves (because you smile more); and you feel great about yourself. And you don’t even need to sweat".</li>
                    </ol>
                    
            
                    <br><li><strong>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</strong></li>
                            Process Model of Mindfulness Mediation. The process starts with Intention. “Start by creating an intention, a reason for wanting to abide in mindfulness.”
                            The next step is too follow your breath. “The classical analogy of this process is a guard standing at the city gates watching people go in and out of the city. ”
                            In the state of distraction the first thing to do is simply regain attentional focus by bringing attention back to the process of breathing. The second thing to do is remember
                            that wandering attention is like flexing your biceps during your gym workout. This is not failure; it is the process of growth and developing powerful mental “muscles.” The third
                            thing to is become aware of yoour attitude towards yourself. Instead of getting angry at yourself simply shift the attitude towards self-kindness and curiosity. This shift is, by itself, 
                            another meditation. Once again, it is about forming mental habits.” Every time we create an attitude of self-directed kindness, we deepen that habit a little bit more, and if we do it a lot,
                            we may overcome a lot of our self-hatred and even become our own best friend. Remember Grandma Mind.<br>

                    <ol>
                        <li> The Seven Point Meditation Posture
             
                            1. Back straight “like an arrow”
                             
                            2. Legs crossed in “lotus position”
                             
                            3. Shoulders relaxed, held up and back, “like a vulture”
                             
                            4. Chin tucked in slightly, “like an iron hook”
            
                            5. Eyes closed or gazing into space
             
                            6. Tongue held against the upper palate
             
                            7. Lips slightly apart, teeth not clenched </li>
            
                        <li> “Sogyal Rinpoche, a world-renowned Tibetan Buddhist teacher, suggests sitting like a majestic mountain. ”</li>
            
                        <li>The Question to either have your eyes opened or closed during meditation. The book suggests that either, both, and neither
                            are good. It also suggests that an option is to have your eyes slightly, look slightly downward, and gaze at nothing in particular</li>
            
                        <li> “Breathing as if your life depends on it". "If you can only remember a single phrase in this chapter, remember this, and you will understand mindfulness meditation.”</li> 
            
                        <li>The Science behind Mediation. <strong>Firstly</strong> the study by Richard Davidson and Jon Kabat-Zinn where anxiety was measurably lower in the participants, there was increased activity 
                            in the parts of their brains associated with positive emotions & they developed more antibodies from the flu shots. <strong>Secondly</strong>, a later study conducted by Heleen Slagter, Antoine Lutz,
                        Richard Davidson, et al., focused on attention. They found that after just three months of intensive and rigorous training in mindfulness meditation, participants can significantly reduce
                        their "attentional blink". The theory is that with mindfulness meditation training, one’s brain can learn to process stimuli more efficiently, hence after processing the first salient target, 
                        it still has the mental resources to process the second number. <strong>Thirdly</strong>, Antoine Lutz showed that adept Buddhist meditators are able to generate high-amplitude gamma brain waves, which are often
                         associated with high effectiveness in memory, learning, and perception. Better still, these adepts exhibit higher gamma-band activity even at baseline, when they are not meditating, suggesting that
                          meditation training can change your brain at rest. If you pump iron a lot, you will have bulging muscles even when you are not working out in the gym. Similarly, when you do a lot of meditation training, 
                          you will have strong mental “muscles” of calmness, clarity, and joy even when you are just hanging out. <strong>Fourthly</strong>, one early study in this field by Jon Kabat-Zinn revealed that mindfulness can greatly accelerate
                        the healing of a skin condition known as psoriasis. <strong>Finally</strong>, there is a study that suggests meditation can thicken your neocortex. This study, conducted by Sara Lazar, took MRI snapshots of mindfulness meditators 
                        and non-meditators, and showed that meditators have a thicker cortex in brain regions associated with attention and sensory processing.Of course, these measurements show correlation, not causation, which means it
                        is entirely possible that people with a thicker cortex in those brain regions just happen to be meditators. However, the study also showed that the longer the meditation subjects have been practicing meditation, the 
                        thicker those parts of their brains are, which suggests that meditation practice is causing those observed changes in the brain.</li>
