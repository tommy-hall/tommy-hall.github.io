              <ul>
                  <li><strong>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</strong></li>
                  
                  Chapter Four talks about emotional awareness, accurate self-assessment and self-confidence. All three of these disciplines require you to pay close attention to your emotional state and most importantly reflect on oneself during and after experienceing high levels of emotions.

                  By applying practiced attention to our emotions this allows us to more accurately understand them. By applying mindfulness to our emotions we can both avoid them taking control over us but also by being attentive to them for an extended period of time we can observe them through all of their phases which should naturally lead to a better understanding of their cause and resolution. 

                  Understanding personal weaknesses can also lead to natural self confidence. If you can understand your weaknesses, which takes more effort and can be just as rewarding. If you know your weaknesses, this means you can anticipate them and plan around them giving you the confidence to approach a task knowing how you can deal with the things that struggle with.<br>



                    <br><li><strong>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</strong></li>

                    In Chapter 1 it was mentioned that emotion is a physiological experience, therefore the best way to create a high-resolution awareness of emotion is by applying mindfulness to the body. The simplest way to do it is to bring mindfulness to your body all the time. Every time you bring mindful attention to your body, you create conditions for neurological changes that allow you to become even more perceptive of your body, and consequently, of the process of emotion.
                    For people that like to do things systemically, there is a formal practice called 'Body Sscan'.

                    'Body Scan' beinng similar to mindfulness mediation but instead of just focusing on breathing, you slowly move your attention around different areas of your body, and try to detect different sensations and emotions. My experience of 'Body Scan' is that I found it to be relaxing and easier to maintain concentration than when just focusing on breathing alone.<br>
                    

            
                    <br><li><strong>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</strong></li>

                    As we deepen our self-awareness, we eventually arrive at a very important key insight: we are not our emotions. We often think of our emotions as being us, e.g. “I am angry” or “I am happy” or “I am sad,” as if anger, happiness, or sadness are us, or become who we are. To the mind, our emotions become our very existence.
                    With enough mindfulness practice, you may eventually notice a difference in that emotions are simply what you feel, not who you are. Emotions become what we experience in the body, so we go from “I am angry” to “I experience anger in my body.”

                    This subtle shift suggests the possibility of mastery over our emotions. 

                    However, if emotions are simply what I experience in my body, then feeling angry becomes a lot like feeling pain in my shoulders after an extreme workout; both are just physiological experiences over which I have influence. I can soothe them. I can ignore them and go get some ice cream, knowing I will feel better in a few hours. 
                    I can experience them mindfully. Fundamentally, I can act on them because they are not my core being. In meditative traditions, we have a beautiful metaphor for this insight. Thoughts and emotions are like clouds—some beautiful, some dark—while our core being is like the sky. Clouds are not the sky; they are phenomena in the sky that come and go. Similarly, thoughts and emotions are not who we are; they are simply phenomena in mind 
                    and body that come and go. Possessing this insight, one creates the possibility of change within oneself.”<br><br>
