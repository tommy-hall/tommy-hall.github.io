              <h2>Problem Solving</h2>
                  
              <br>One time I got stuck on trying to push my local repository to GitHub. To solve the problem I applied the ‘reading error messages’, ‘googling’ & ‘asking your peers for help’ techniques.<br> 

                <br>The ‘reading error messages’ technique was helpful as I was able to see the errors that would come when I was using the Terminal. Therefore, I was able realise that I have made an error & read the ‘error messages’ as too why the command had not gone through. I need to remember to practise breathing 
                and mindfulness when there’s a complex error message as it can be frustrating when you spent over an hour trying to figure out an error.  Remembering I’m not the first developer ever to be faced with this error, and you won't be the last. No matter what happens, me and my team can handle it. The second
                technique I used was ‘Googling’. I would research this error in Google too read articles/ forums or watch videos on YouTube on ‘how to push to GitHub’. Remembering that programmers at the highest level of development do it all the time. The true crime would be to have a massive resource of knowledge at your 
                disposal, and not to use it! However forming the correct search can be tricky, especially as a beginner. It can be hard to verbalize what you don’t understand. Even if it seems fruitless, put together a few key words: it’s likely some answer will be returned. The final technique was ‘asking your peers for help’. 
                On the Cohort Slack Channel I reached out & I ended up getting an answer on the channel and then further having a direct conversation with one of the Cohort members. The other member was very helpful and by discussing & bouncing ideas of each other we managed to figure out the problem which was I wasn’t in the correct 
                folder to push the local repository to GitHub. Sharing knowledge & providing guidance is powerful tool for problem solving as often the other member has solved the same or a similar issue, they go over the concept again to gain further clarification & it also provides more collaboration & trust between you and that person.

                <br><br>Although a problem may be very frustrating at the time of solving the issue, I learnt that there’s many different problem solving techniques and process’s that can be used to help solve the problem.

                <br><br>Firstly, remember too properly formatted your code. This can't be emphasised enough. Properly formatted code will allow you to see your work (and that of others) more clearly. It will make some mistakes obvious, and reduce the chance of making others. Here are some other steps to try:<br><br>

                <ol>

                <li>Pseudocode</li>
                <li>Try something!</li>
                <li>Simplify</li>
                <li>Read error message</li>
                <li>Improve visibility of problems using console output</li>
                <li>Debuggers</li>
                <li>Rubber ducky</li>
                <li>Google</li>
                <li>Blocked? Read out to Peers, Coaches & utilise the Slack Channel</li>
                <li>Reflect</li>

                </ol>
